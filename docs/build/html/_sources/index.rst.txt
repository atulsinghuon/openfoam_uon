Welcome to OpenFOAM on ADA documentation!
=========================================

OpenFOAM is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software application that
is part of a strong open source community. It is widely recognized for its command like interface, versatile simulation capabilities, and advanced features. With support for both 2D and 3D simulations, parallel processing, and scripting in C++, OpenFOAM offers a comprehensive solution for simulating fluid flow and heat transfer in various engineering applications. Its strength lies in robust meshing,extensive physics models, and specialized modules for applications like combustion and multiphase flow.

There are two branches for OpenFOAM, 

1. One is OpenFOAM Foundation (www.openfoam.org)
2. Other is OpenCFD Ltd (www.openfoam.com) (Tutorials obtained from here)
